### The ABS(x) function-like macro

ABS(x) is a preprocessor macro in C
that computes the absolute value of a number x.
The absolute value of a number is its distance from zero.

For Example, if x is a positive number, then the absolute value of x is x,
and if x is negative (in which case negating x makes it positive), then the absolute value of x is -x.
